In all fields of science and technology the amount of data are growing
rapidly. Analysing them can be more challenging than ever and hence
powerful models should be used. In this sense, Rigby and Stasinopoulos
(2005) proposed the generalised additive models for location, scale and
shape (GAMLSS). GAMLSS are really flexible semi-parametric regression
models that involve a distribution for the response variable (that does
not necessarily belongs to the exponential family) and may involve
parametric linear and/or non-parametric smoothing terms when modelling
any or all of the parameters of the distribution as functions of
explanatory variables. This talk will be a basic exposition about the
GAMLSS models and how it can be applied in real life examples, using the
R package.
